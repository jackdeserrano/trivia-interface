And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: / And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live. / But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive. / And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive? / And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them. / Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty. / And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses. / And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.

``In the early sixties, $X$ visited Harvard while Zariski was still a faculty member. Once, while Zariski was lecturing in a seminar, $X$ kept asking him why he didn't prove the result for all schemes, not just varieties, but Zariski simply responded that it didn't work. Eventually, $X$ could stand it no longer and went to the blackboard and began writing down a proof for schemes. While he did so, Zariski wrote down a counter-example. When $X$ realized he was wrong, Zariski said (in his heavily accented Russo-Italian English) `In my time, I have had to learn many languages.' At this, $X$ turned bright red from embarrassment.''
