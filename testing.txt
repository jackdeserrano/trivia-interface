Identify the writer: ``When sacred Night sweeps heavenward, she takes the glad, the winsome day, and folding it, rolls up its golden carpet that had been spread over an abysmal pit. Gone vision-like is the external world, and man, a homeless orphan, has to face, in utter helplessness, naked, alone, the blackness of immeasurable space. Upon himself he has to lean; with mind abolished, thought unfathered, in the dim depths of his soul he sinks, for nothing comes from outside to support or limit him. All life and brightness seem an ancient dream---while in the substance of the night, unravelled, alien, he now perceives a fateful something that is his by right.''
