This Christian sect flourished in North Africa in the fourth and fifth centuries and was named after a bishop of Carthage. It asserted that only those living a blameless life belonged in the Church, and, in particular, that sacraments administered by traditores were invalid, opposite to the view that sacraments are ex opere operato. In 311, Caecilian was consecrated bishop of Carthage by Felix of Aptungi, a supposed traditor. His opponents consecrated Majorinus, a short-lived rival of Caecilian succeeded by the sect's leader and now-eponym. The sect burgeoned and the African Church fragmented; unrest mounted in Carthage over the bishop controversy. Constantine, looking to defuse the situation, donated to Caecilian to pay for churches damaged during the Diocletianic Persecution; he gave nothing to the opponents of Caecilian; they appealed to Rome, whence Constantine charged Pope Miltiades with resolving the conflict. The Pope convoked a commission in 313, and it condemned the sect. The sect did not agree with the condemnation and appealed to Constantine. Constantine called for the first Council of Arles, which took place in 314. The council condemned the sect's doctrine as heresy, and the sect's leader was excommunicated. Churches of the sect outside of Carthage were undisturbed, and, by 321, Constantine asked bishops to show moderation and patience toward the sect. It survived the Vandal occupation and the Byzantine reconquest of Justinian I.
