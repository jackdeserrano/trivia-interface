To be, or not to be, that is the question: / Whether `tis nobler in the mind to suffer / The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, / Or to take arms against a sea of troubles / And by opposing end them. To die --- to sleep, / No more; and by a sleep to say we end / The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks / That flesh is heir to: `tis a consummation / Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; / To sleep, perchance to dream --- ay, there's the rub: / For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, / When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, / Must give us pause --- there's the respect / That makes calamity of so long life. / For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, / Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, / The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay, / The insolence of office, and the spurns / That patient merit of th'unworthy takes, / When he himself might his quietus make / With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear, / To grunt and sweat under a weary life, / But that the dread of something after death, / The undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn / No traveller returns, puzzles the will, / And makes us rather bear those ills we have / Than fly to others that we know not of? / Thus conscience doth make cowards of us all, / And thus the native hue of resolution / Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, / And enterprises of great pith and moment / With this regard their currents turn awry / And lose the name of action.

It consists of the four elements, with fire representing the spirit concealed in matter. This is the fourth, absent and yet present, who always appears in the fiery agony of the furnace and symbolizes the divine presence --- succour and the completion of the work.''

What proto-oncogenic tumour suppressor protein is dysfunctional in several major cancers? One of its functions is to prevent excessive cell growth by inhibiting cell cycle progression until a cell is ready to divide. When the cell is ready to divide, this protein is phosphorylated, inactivating it, and the cell cycle is allowed to progress. It is also a recruiter of several chromatin remodelling enzymes such as methylases and acetylases. When it is mutated, it becomes nonfunctional and cannot inhibit the expression of E2F, whence it is always active, driving the cell cycle to progress from G1 to S phase, and cell growth and division are unregulated, causing tumour formation in the eye.

``In the early sixties, $X$ visited Harvard while Zariski was still a faculty member. Once, while Zariski was lecturing in a seminar, $X$ kept asking him why he didn't prove the result for all schemes, not just varieties, but Zariski simply responded that it didn't work. Eventually, $X$ could stand it no longer and went to the blackboard and began writing down a proof for schemes. While he did so, Zariski wrote down a counter-example. When $X$ realized he was wrong, Zariski said (in his heavily accented Russo-Italian English) `In my time, I have had to learn many languages.' At this, $X$ turned bright red from embarrassment.''

``About 150 years ago, according to legend, a young brave wanted to witness the plunge of countless buffalo as his people drove them to their deaths over the sandstone cliffs. Standing under the shelter of a ledge, like a man behind a waterfall, he watched the great beasts cascade past him. But the hunt was unusually good that day and as the bodies mounted, he became trapped between the animals and the cliff. When his people came to do the butchering, they found him with his skull crushed by the weight of the buffalo.'' What was the name of this site thus named?

He falls in love with and wins over a schoolteacher named Dora. Guido and Dora marry and have a son named Giosuè, and they run a bookstore. In 1944, the Nazis occupy Northern Italy, and Guido, his uncle Eliseo, and Giosuè are seized and to be taken to a concentration camp. Dora volunteers to go with them, but men and women are separated at the camp. Guido sends messages by loudspeaker to assure Dora that he and Giosuè are safe. To shield his son, Guido tells Giosuè that the camp is some complicated game, and the winning prize is a tank. They play the game the whole way through; in the end, the camp is being shut down as the Allies approach. As his final task, Guido tells Giosuè to stay in a box until everyone has left. Guido goes to find Dora, but he is spotted by a German soldier; Guido is ordered to be executed, and, walking to his death, he passes Giosuè one last time and winks at him. Guido is shot and left for dead. The morning after, Giosuè comes out of the box just as a U. S. Army unit led by a tank arrives and liberates the camp. Giosuè is ecstatic that he won the game, and an American soldier allows Giosuè to ride on the tank. Giosuè espies Dora proceeding out of the camp, and he and his mother are reunited, telling her that he won a tank as his father promised. Name the film.

It is the handiwork of a divine Craftsman (ὁ δημιουργὸς, 28a6) who, imitating an unchanging and eternal model, imposes mathematical order on a pre-existent chaos to generate the ordered universe (ἡ κόσμος). The governing explanatory principle of the account is teleological: the universe as a whole as well as its various parts are so arranged as to produce a vast array of good effects. For Plato, this arrangement is not fortuitous, but the outcome of the deliberate intent of Intellect (ὁ νοῦς), anthropomorphically represented by the figure of the Craftsman who plans and constructs a world that is as excellent as its nature permits it to be'' (Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy).
