O Freunde, nicht diese Töne! / Sondern laßt uns angenehmere / anstimmen und freudenvollere! / Freude, schöner Götterfunken, / Tochter aus Elysium, / Wir betreten feuertrunken, / Himmlische, dein Heiligtum! / Deine Zauber binden wieder, / Was die Mode streng geteilt; / Alle Menschen werden Brüder, / Wo dein sanfter Flügel weilt. / Wem der große / Wurf gelungen, / Eines Freundes Freund zu sein, / Wer ein holdes Weib errungen, / Mische seinen Jubel ein! / Ja, wer auch nur eine Seele / Sein nennt auf dem Erdenrund! / Und wer's nie gekonnt, der stehle / Weinend sich aus diesem Bund. / Freude trinken alle Wesen / An den Brüsten der Natur; / Alle Guten, alle Bösen / Folgen ihrer Rosenspur. / Küsse gab sie uns und Reben, / Einen Freund, geprüft im Tod; / Wollust ward dem Wurm gegeben, / Und der Cherub steht vor Gott! / Froh, wie seine Sonnen fliegen / Durch des Himmels prächt'gen Plan, / Laufet, Brüder, eure Bahn, / Freudig, wie ein Held zum Siegen. / Seid umschlungen, Millionen. / Diesen Kuß der ganzen Welt! / Brüder! Über'm Sternenzelt / Muß ein lieber Vater wohnen. / Ihr stürzt nieder, Millionen? / Ahnest du den Schöpfer, Welt? / Such' ihn über'm Sternenzelt! / Über Sternen muß er wohnen.

What are the words to Hamlet's best-known soliloquy?
To be, or not to be, that is the question: / Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer / The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, / Or to take arms against a sea of troubles / And by opposing end them. To die---to sleep, / No more; and by a sleep to say we end / The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks / That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation / Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; / To sleep, perchance to dream---ay, there's the rub: / For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, / When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, / Must give us pause---there's the respect / That makes calamity of so long life. / For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, / Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, / The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay, / The insolence of office, and the spurns / That patient merit of th'unworthy takes, / When he himself might his quietus make / With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear, / To grunt and sweat under a weary life, / But that the dread of something after death, / The undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn / No traveller returns, puzzles the will, / And makes us rather bear those ills we have / Than fly to others that we know not of? / Thus conscience doth make cowards of us all, / And thus the native hue of resolution / Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, / And enterprises of great pith and moment / With this regard their currents turn awry / And lose the name of action.
